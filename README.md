# SampleUnityScriptTestHarness
Develop and test OnBase Unity scripts outside of OnBase using Visual Studio.

Scripting in OnBase has significantly improved since the early days of typing VBScript in a plain text control. However, as the capabilities of the Unity API have increase the built in development tools have lagged and remain largely only appropriate for short, simple scripts. Fortunately, with some planning and a little extra code, Unity Script and Unity Library code can be developed and tested using Visual Studio with a direct link to the development instance of OnBase.

Synchronization with Unity Editor is the bottleneck for the time being. Hyland does not offer any automated methods to export or import Unity projects.
